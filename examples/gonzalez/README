Hi John - I've included here four relatively simple scripts that
should contain useful examples of fits read/write with pyfits, calling
of pyraf commands, and use of subroutines. These are from my work on
the NEWFIRM survey. The scripts are moderately commented, but here's a
brief description of each:

newalign.py	- Align images using scamp
newstack.py	- Stack images using swarp
catalog.py	- Generated source extractor catalogs for the images
SExtractor.py	- Subroutines for source extractor
tweakzpt.py	- Query 2MASS, cross-match with objects in the image, and compute a median zeropoint for an image.
