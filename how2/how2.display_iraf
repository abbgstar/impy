Hi John,

the easiest way I know how is to create a script to do it.  For
example, list the files you want to display into a file, e.g.,
ls *.fits > dispfiles.  Then write a script that takes dispfiles
and create an IRAF script from it.  So, for example, on your
Linux prompt, do:

% ls *.fits > dispfiles
% awk '{print "display", $1, "1 zr+ zs+"}' dispfiles > displayme.cl

Then in IRAF, do:

cl> task $displayme = displayme.cl
cl> displayme

That should do it.

I think even:

% awk '{print "imexam", $1"[0]"}' list

should work..., i.e. get rid of the comma between $1 and "[0]"
