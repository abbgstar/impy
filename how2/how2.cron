To look at cron jobs.

% crontab -l    # list cron jobs
% crontab -e    # add or edit a cron job
% crontab -r    # remove a cron job

If you want to setup a cron job you can make a file called 
crontab that has a sequence of commands.  Then type

% crontab crontab

Then the file crontab doesn't have to exist anymore.
