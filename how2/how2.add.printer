Subject: Re: printing

Sorry for the delay in my response.  Things have been very busy for the 
past few days with Jeff out.  We still haven't tackled the RedHat 9 
printing issue yet.  I think the best thing you can do would be to add the 
library printer (lw1) as 
Tools -> System Settings -> Printing -> New -> Forward

Queue Name: lw1
Queue Type: JetDirect Printer

Printer IP: lw1.as.arizona.edu
Port: 9100

Then set the printer to an HP LaserJet 5si.

Please let me know if you need my assistance with this.

Thanks,
Neal
