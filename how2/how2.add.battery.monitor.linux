Hi John,

I did finally find the battery monitor (Add to Panel > Utility > Battery
Charge Monitor).  At first it did not work (showed 0% all the time).  I
did a bit of searching and found a fix.  I added "acpi=on" to the end of
the line in /boot/grub/grub.conf which start with "kernel 
/vmlinuz-2.4.22".  Once I rebooted the battery monitor started working 
fine.

Andy
