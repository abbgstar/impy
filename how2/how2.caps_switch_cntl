To switch your CAPS LOCK and CNTL buttons on a PC keyboard create the
following file called .xmodrc and put it in ${HOME}.

          !
          ! Swap Caps_Lock and Control_L
          !
          remove Lock = Caps_Lock
          remove Control = Control_L
          keysym Control_L = Caps_Lock
          keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
          add Lock = Caps_Lock
          add Control = Control_L

Then add the following line to your .cshrc:

	/usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap ${HOME}/.xmodrc
