Server setup:
-------------

[1] As root: Create a user called 'cvs' with "Redhat User Manager."
Set the password to something temporary then edit the /etc/shadow file
to make the password '*' (i.e., no log-in allowed).  The password in
that file lives between the first two colons after the user name.
Also make the 'cvs' user part of the 'ioannis' group.

[2] As ioannis: generate a normal ssh key pair for the 'cvs' user:

% ssh-keygen -t dsa
% echo 'no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,command="/usr/bin/cvs server"' > cvsjunk
% paste cvsjunk .ssh/id_dsa.pub > .ssh/authorized_keys2
% \rm cvsjunk

[3] Put the .ssh/id_dsa file that was generated after running
'ssh-keygen' at the end of the ssh_anonymous_cvs file, which was
obtained from http://kitenet.net/programs/perlmoo/sshcvs.  Replace 
the existing private key.

[4] As root, create a directory /var/lock/cvs and give write
permissions to group 'ioannis.'  Also make sure to change the group to
'ioannis'.  Then as 'ioannis', check out the CVSROOT repository and
edit the CVSROOT/config file such that the Lock_Dir=/var/lock/cvs.
Commit the changes.

Client procedure:
-----------------

To check out a package from a cvs repository do the following:

[1] Download the ssh_anonymous_cvs file and place it anywhere.  Make
it executable with

% chmod +x ssh_anonymous_cvs

[2] Type 

% setenv CVS_RSH ${HOME}/ssh_anonymous_cvs
% cvs -d :ext:cvs@cerebus.as.arizona.edu:/home/ioannis/cvs_repository checkout ispec
